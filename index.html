    <h2>Our Green Plumbing Services</h2>
    <p>We offer a variety of eco-friendly plumbing solutions for both homes and businesses. Here’s how we’re helping the Rockford community reduce its environmental footprint:</p>

    <h3>1. Water-Efficient Fixture Upgrades</h3>
    <p>Upgrade to water-saving fixtures such as low-flow toilets, faucets, and showerheads. These products offer the same functionality but use less water, resulting in lower utility bills and reduced water consumption.</p>

    <h3>2. Tankless Water Heaters</h3>
    <p>Switch to energy-efficient tankless water heaters, which heat water only when needed. This eliminates energy waste and helps you save on energy bills while still providing an endless supply of hot water.</p>

    <h3>3. Leak Detection & Repair</h3>
    <p>Even small leaks can waste gallons of water. Our advanced leak detection services quickly locate and repair leaks, preventing water loss and protecting your home or business from further damage.</p>

    <h3>4. Eco-Friendly Drain Cleaning</h3>
    <p>We use safe, non-toxic methods to clean your drains, avoiding harsh chemicals that can harm your plumbing system and the environment.</p>

    <h3>5. Pipe Insulation</h3>
    <p>Proper pipe insulation reduces heat loss and improves the efficiency of your water heater. We offer professional insulation services to reduce your heating costs and improve your plumbing system's overall performance.</p>

    <h3>6. Water Filtration Systems</h3>
    <p>Install a whole-home water filtration system to reduce plastic waste from bottled water. Our eco-friendly solutions provide clean, filtered water directly from your taps, improving both taste and safety.</p>
